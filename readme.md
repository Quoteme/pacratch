# Pacratch

Pacratch is a game which I designed when I was still in elementary
school. After school finished, me and some other kids went to some
daycare where we were encouraged to participate in creative activities.

The name "Pacratch" is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau)
of pacman and rat. Back in the days I felt like my game would be about
small animal-like creatures fighting. So there I got the idea for the
name.

After all these years, I finally got to paint some monsters that look
kinda decent with my Thinkpad X201T and I added some Information about
them in JSON files. Loading them into the game was very easy after that!

## TODO

- Add Pacracher (the monsters in the game)
- Add a simple UI to interact with the attacks and enemies
- status effects
- enemy-selection screen

## Rules

Each player is given the option to select an arbitrary number of
Pacrachter (although it should first be discussed how many should
be allowed). After that each player takes turns to select an attack and
an opponent whom to attack (some attacks may target multiple opponents).
After everyone has finished selecting attacks and opponents the
Pacrachter will attack in the order of who is fastest.
A Pacratch is defeated, if it has no more HP left. Analogously a
trainer is defeated, if all their Pacratcher are defeated.
The last player to be not defeated is the winner.
